# Future Game Modes (Scaffolds)

These folders are **starting points** for future Agent Arena game modes.
They are intentionally kept clean and separated while in-progress.

## Status
- Not production-ready
- Not integrated into live matchmaking yet
- Used for planning, architecture, and incremental implementation

## Games
- `games/agent-mafia/`
- `games/agents-among-us/`

Each game should evolve independently until ready to merge into the main Arena gameplay loop.
