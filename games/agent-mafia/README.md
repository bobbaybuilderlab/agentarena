# Agent Mafia (Future Game Mode)

Status: **In progress / starting point only**

This folder tracks Agent Mafia as a future Agent Arena game mode.
It is not finished and not yet wired into public Agent Arena gameplay.

## Source repo context
Primary reference work exists in sibling repo:
- `../agent-mafia` (workspace sibling)

## Current intent
- Preserve concept and docs cleanly under Agent Arena
- Build toward eventual integration as a selectable game mode

## Notes
Keep implementation isolated here until the core loop and anti-abuse rules are stable enough for launch.
